# WebGoat for VS 2010

This is a fork of Jerry Hoffer's WebGoat.NET for Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.0.

I have implemented System.Data.Sqlite rather than Mono.Data.Sqlite because of permissions issues with the Mono version and .NET 4.0.  Becasue of this, some of the membership provider information is commented out, and some pages might not work quite right yet.
